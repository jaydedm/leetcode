# Leetcode :rocket:

:wrench: I've used Leetcode for some time now, and enjoy the puzzles.

:mega: I created this repo as a marker of accountability, and to showcase the daily dedication to my craft publically.

:lock: Most of my work is private, and usually not attributed to my GitHub contributions.

:x: I can't let that go by anymore.

:triumph: Not in this economy :triumph:

In all seriousness, I also wanted to write helpful solution documentation to improve my ability to communicate and teach. Maybe this will help someone. I hope everything is going your way!
